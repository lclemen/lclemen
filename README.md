Hello,

I'm Layne. I am a mechatronics systems engineer with a background in systems modeling, controls, and firmware. I am currently researching and learning the 
intersections of nearual nets and predictive control. I would like to collaborate on projects that use neural nets to represent dynamic physical system for control 
and embedded control control projects.

I can be reached by email at lclemen(at)gmail.com
